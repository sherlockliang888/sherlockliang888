 I am Fengshou and you may call me Sherlock. I have just graduated from [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) 🎓 and I am looking forward to learning and exploring more about data analytics and data science. 
  <p align = "left"> What am I up to now..? I am currently taking more courses related to data via Coursera and doing projects on my own📚 I also started my post-graduate study program on <a href = "https://www.georgebrown.ca/programs/applied-ai-solutions-development-program-t431?year=2020">Applied A.I. Solutions Development</a> in January 2021 at George Brown College. This program will help me better prepare for the role of a Full Stack Data Scientist, who is qualified to fill the roles of Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Data Engineer or Machine Learning Engineer as needed. I will be given preparatory training and simulated experiences in tailoring their presentations to various target audiences including technical, business and investors. </p>
